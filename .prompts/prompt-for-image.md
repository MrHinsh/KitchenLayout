**#2 – Hob Section (1000 mm total width)**
- IO Mabe 900 mm gas hob (black tempered glass, 5 burners)
- **Critical:** Matte black aluminium infill surround (100 mm width, wraps full perimeter, sits flush with granite)
- Deep Parota drawers below (no oven)

**#3 – Vertical Pull-Out Pantry** (150-200 mm, Parota)

5. **Upper cabinets** extend floor-to-ceiling, no gaps or bulkheads
6. **Handleless design** – no visible hardware anywhere

8. **Parota wood** shows natural dark grain, matte finish (not glossy)
9. **Room geometry** matches original image exactly
10. **Lighting** matches original image angles and natural light sources
