## Pre-Installation Requirements

1. **Survey existing outlets** - Map all current outlet locations and circuit capacities
2. **Verify oven circuit installation** - 220V circuit must be complete before cabinet installation
3. **Test existing circuits** - Confirm all circuits to be used are functioning and properly grounded
4. **Plan outlet accessibility** - Ensure all outlets remain accessible after cabinet installation

## Panel Labeling
All circuits (new and existing) to be clearly labeled in the electrical panel with location and purpose.

## Environmental Considerations
All wiring and connections rated for humid tropical conditions.
